# Hi

I'm a student triyng to figure out how to become a succesfull software developer (kinda hard?)

My actual resume and knowledge:
- Beginner-Intermediate C#
- Intermediate-Advance git
- Beginner HTML



Goals:
[ ] - 👋 Improve this bio-resume in the future
[ ] - 👀 Learning SQL.... 
[ ] - 🌱 Once I get enough of C#, got through HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Notes:
- 💞️ Feel free to colaborate in any repo of mine, they're just simple personal proyects in c# so far
- 📫 Open to any new idea to work with...
